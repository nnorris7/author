		<p>Salem, Massachusetts—Ten years ago...</p>
		<br />
		<p>“Jesus, Cal. I realize your family’s close, but do we really need your kid brother tagging along with us?”</p>
		<p>Cal Smith looked at his best friend as the man leaned against the truck, the light of the full moon setting his face off in harsh relief. His hands were pushed deep into his jeans pockets, with a familiar scowl shaping his lips. Cal had known Dave Harper since first grade and had spent more time crawling through old buildings and abandoned ruins with the guy than was probably wise. But this was the first time he’d commented on one of Cal’s brothers accompanying them.</p>
		<p>He glanced at Avery, his brother’s movements tracked by the glare of the headlights as the man surveyed the front of the house. Though it looked innocent enough, Cal knew Avery was picking up on far more than he and Dave ever would, though Cal still didn’t fully understand Avery’s abilities. But whatever they were, the man had a knack at unearthing what others missed, and that fact alone was proof enough he needed to be part of the team.</p>
		<p>Cal gave Dave a shove. “Avery’s twenty-one. Hardly a kid anymore. And since when do you care? He and Blake have joined us before, and you never seemed to give a shit.”</p>
		<p>Dave kicked at the gravel drive, glancing at the house over his shoulder. “This time’s different.”</p>
		<p>Cal cocked an eyebrow. “How?”</p>
		<p>Dave pursed his lips. “You know damn well how. This is it, Cal. Our big break.” He waved at the house. “This place has been the scene of more than a few murders over the past fifty years. And none of them have been solved. I’m telling you...there’s something wrong with this house. Something in there doesn’t want people poking around. If we can document what that is, we’ll be famous. Finally, get out of that shack we call an office and make something of ourselves.”</p>
		<p>“Since when is this about seeing our name on the front page of the newspaper?”</p>
		<p>Dave scoffed, palming one hand on the hood of the truck. “That’s rich coming from you.”</p>
		<p>A frown tugged at Cal’s mouth as he straightened. “You know better than anyone that I’ve never used my family’s name...or their money. Everything we’ve accomplished over the past four years has been earned.”</p>
		<p>“Why use their money when you have plenty of your own?”</p>
		<p>There was no mistaking the accusation in Dave’s voice, or the way he sneered as he glanced at Avery again as if the man’s presence had revealed feelings he’d never confided in Cal before.</p>
		<p>Cal fisted his hands, trying to keep the anger burning a hole in his gut from surfacing. “There something you want to say to me, Dave? ‘Cause we’ve been friends since we were six, and I can’t believe you’ve waited until now to discuss my financial success.” He cursed under his breath, shuffling his feet. “Shit. This is because of the other night, isn’t it? Look, just because I said I have feelings for your sister doesn’t mean I’m going to act on them, not if dating Jordan is going to ruin our friendship. I’d never do that to you.”</p>
		<p>Though just thinking about the girl made Cal’s head spin. He’d spent the better part of seventeen years watching the brat grow up. He just hadn’t counted on her </span><span style="line-height: 20px; " class="style_4">growing</span><span style="line-height: 20px; " class="style_3"> so fast, or on her becoming the object of every fantasy he’d ever had. She was smart, funny and so damn pretty his eyes hurt. All it took was a smile and his heart practically beat clear out of his chest. He’d been fighting his attraction to her for what felt like forever, but he’d finally had to admit to himself that somewhere between teasing her and looking out for her, he’d fallen in love with the feisty blonde.</p>
		<p>Dave simply shrugged. “This has nothing to do with Jordan. I could care less if you date her, even if she is way out of your league. She’d be crazy to settle for a playboy type like you—you know, all flash and cash. But whatever. I suppose she could do worse. And maybe I didn’t mention any of this before because I didn’t have cause to. But I’m starting to see where this venture is heading, and the only name that keeps flashing in my mind is Smith.”</p>
		<p>Cal took a step back, not sure how to take Dave’s comments, when the crunch of gravel sounded behind them. He pulled his mouth tight, hoping he didn’t look as riled as he felt as Avery appeared beyond Dave’s shoulder, half of his face illuminated by the rising moonlight. His brother stopped a few feet away, his gaze falling to Dave as he drew his brows into a vee. Cal cursed. Avery had obviously picked up on the tension between them, and Cal could only pray the man would show some level of tact.</p>
		<p>Dave saved him the worry by pushing off the truck and stalking to the rear, flicking on a flashlight as he lowered the tailgate with a distinctive slam. Cal winced at the sound, running a hand through his hair as his brother shook his head and moved closer.</p>
		<p>Avery thumbed at Dave. “What the hell’s wrong with him?”</p>
		<p>Cal kicked at the gravel, trying to keep his emotions in check, but it wasn’t easy. Shit. Did Dave really think that little of him? Had he done something to piss the guy off and not realized it? Was he really the kind of guy Jordan would have to settle for?</p>
		<p>He drew his mouth tight, avoiding eye contact with Avery as he stared at the house. “He’s just wired.”</p>
		<p>Avery raised a brow. “You do realize I can tell when you’re lying, right? Not to mention the fact the man’s thoughts are practically tattooed across his forehead.” Avery sighed and took a step closer. “Look. If my being here is going to come between you two—”</p>
		<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. You’ve got more natural talent than Dave and I combined. Don’t think I don’t know that, or Dave for that matter. Besides, there’s safety in numbers, especially with Dave determined to investigate this place during the night. Call me crazy, but I prefer to challenge spirits before the stroke of twelve gives them an energy boost.”</p>
		<p>Avery nodded, glancing at Dave over his shoulder. “Energy boost or not doesn’t change the fact that there’s a dark energy surrounding this place that’s off the charts. I know this sounds odd, but...maybe it’s affecting Dave. Making his less than desirable qualities take center stage.” He nudged Cal. “Making him say crazy shit he doesn’t really mean.”</p>
		<p>Cal frowned, wondering how much of the conversation he’d overheard. “Is that even possible? And how do you know all this anyway? I mean, I realize the place has history, but...”</p>
		<p>Avery smiled. “Blake made a few new toys for me to try out. Don’t tell him I said this, but...the kid’s got promise.” He turned on an overly large flashlight and placed it on the hood of the truck before holding up the remains of a metal detector. “He’s rigged this thing to measure electromagnetic energy. The needle moves to the right when there’s an unusual amount, and this thing was pegged all the way over. He also gave me this.”</p>
		<p>Cal took the unit Avery held out to him, smiling. “Isn’t this dad’s prized handheld radio from the ‘good old days’?”</p>
		<p>“It used to be. Blake modified it.”</p>
		<p>Cal shook his head. “Do I even want to know what baby brother did to it? I’d like to avoid having dad tear a strip off me once he discovers the kid’s been getting creative again.”</p>
		<p>Avery waved it off. “You know dad’s all show where Blake’s concerned. Probably because he recognizes brilliance when he sees it. Besides, this thing’s awesome. Blake’s got it scanning through all the channels in quick succession. The white noise allows spirits to actually communicate with us—there’ve been a few made in the field, but I guarantee Blake’s exceeds any to date. I gave it a quick test run at the old abandoned schoolhouse back home. The results were impressive. This will change how we investigate. I just did a quick session by the front porch, and I’ve already had more than a few voices tell me to get the hell out of here.”</p>
		<p>Cal sighed, glancing at Dave again. The man had removed the remaining equipment and was setting up some static night cameras on the lawn. Even with only the light of the moon, Cal could see the stiff line of Dave’s back. The guy wasn’t just upset. He was pissed.</p>
		<p>Cal gave Avery a pat on the shoulder. “Just do me a favor and keep those weird Jedi mind powers of yours in check. While I don’t really understand what it is you do, the last thing I need is Dave calling my little brother a freak. I’d hate to have to punch the guy in the face. We are best friends.”</p>
		<p>Avery smiled. “I’ll do my best. Just...” He paused, glancing around the property. “Be careful. There’s something off about this place, and it’s more than just the usual angry spirits. I can’t quite place it, but I sense this house is more dangerous than anyone suspects—especially this time of night.”</p>
		<p>“Strange. Dave said something similar...about this place being wrong.” He scrubbed his hand down his face, giving Avery a shove. “Let’s get going. And don’t go wandering off on your own, just in case.”</p>
		<p>“Wouldn’t dream of it, big brother.”</p>
		<p>Cal chuckled at the amused tone in Avery’s voice and headed across the yard. Hopefully Avery was right, and Dave’s new attitude was merely a product of the environment. He didn’t want to think his buddy had been harboring resentment all these years and would be happy to chalk it up to an overload of external circumstances. Thankfully, Dave’s demeanor seemed improved when Cal joined the man as Dave headed for the rear of the property.</p>
		<p>He glanced at Cal over his shoulder, pointing at the set of windows lined along the upper story. “A number of the deaths occurred in those rooms on the second story and in the attic. I thought we’d roll some video footage in case we can catch a glimpse of something while we’re inside investigating.”</p>
		<p>Cal nodded, shining his flashlight along the glass, wondering why he didn’t feel the same eerie darkness the other men did, when something blurred across the attic. Cold shivers raced down his spine as he squinted to get a better look, but only the reflection of the rising moon glared back at him.</p>
		<p>Dave walked up behind him, nudging his arm. “Something wrong? You’ve got that weird look on your face you get when you’re trying to puzzle something out.”</p>
		<p>“Not sure. I thought I saw something dart past that attic window.” Cal turned to Dave. “I realize you got permission for us to investigate tonight, but...are you sure no one’s here? It looked more solid than our usual encounters.”</p>
		<p>Dave shrugged. “Beats the hell out of me. They said this place has been deserted for years but—”</p>
		<p>“Nearly seventy, really.” Avery’s voice sounded behind him, and they turned as the man moved in behind.</p>
		<p>Avery held up some papers. “I printed out some information I found on the Internet. Strangely, the history of this place is extremely limited, though I was able to unearth a few interesting facts. Seems the site this house was built on dates back to the mid-sixteen hundreds.”</p>
		<p>Dave scoffed, grabbing a fist full of the sheets and shuffling through them. “That’s ridiculous. This house isn’t more than eighty years old.”</p>
		<p>Avery glanced at Cal and Cal could tell the man was resisting rolling his eyes.</p>
		<p>His brother gave Dave a curt nod. “Eighty-two to be precise. But I said this site, not this house. Seems there have been four buildings constructed on this property over a span of nearly four hundred years. The first three were burnt to the ground.”</p>
		<p>Dave scowled. “Burnt? All three?”</p>
		<p>“Seems the good people of Salem thought the women of the houses were witches.”</p>
		<p>Dave laughed this time. “Come on, Avery. I can see the original...maybe even the replacement, but are you seriously telling me that someone burnt this house down in the early nineteen hundreds because they thought the owner was a witch?”</p>
		<p>Avery merely smiled. “Not everyone adopts the beliefs of their times. And hatred can live longer than any of us, especially when it’s bred over the centuries.” Avery held up his hand when Dave continued to shake his head. “Look, whether that’s the real reason or not, it might explain why this place exudes such a dark presence. It means that more than just several random murders have happened here in the past fifty years and that the lineages date back hundreds of years.”</p>
		<p>Dave sighed, some of the uneasiness lifting from his expression. “And that our chances of recording some proof just increased.” He gave Cal the first real smile since they’d arrived. “Witches, huh? I say let’s go talk to the ladies.”</p>
		<p>Cal nodded, turning to follow Dave back to the front of the house, more than a bit confused at the man’s sudden change, when Avery snagged his shirt. He glanced at his brother, noting the worry creasing his brow.</p>
		<p>Avery nodded after Dave. “You might want to keep an eye on him. Something’s...off about him.”</p>
		<p>“I thought you said it was just the energy of this place? That the house was off not him.”</p>
		<p>“I did but...just stick close to him.”</p>
		<p>Cal frowned as Avery moved past him. He didn’t like the way this investigation was shaping up, and they hadn’t even stepped inside yet. He took a calming breath and headed for the front porch, flashing his light across the attic window one last time, wondering what it was that had darted past the glass just minutes before, hoping it was nothing more than some kids sneaking around on a dare. Dave and Avery were waiting by the door when he rounded the property, their heads bent close together as Avery showed him the gadgets Blake had made. Cal released the breath he’d been holding. At least the tension between the two men had seemed to have eased.</p>
		<p>He stopped next to them, motioning to the door. “The place looks pretty sturdy for being abandoned.”</p>
		<p>Avery chuckled. “Technically, it’s just unoccupied. According to the records, this house still belongs to the Winslow family. It’s been up for sale a number of times, but no one seems willing to buy it. The management company said no one’s lived here since the early forties.”</p>
		<p>Cal pursed his lips. “But that means they only stayed for a few years after it was rebuilt.”</p>
		<p>“And that simple fact makes you wonder why, doesn’t it?” Avery looked at the door. “What would make them leave that quickly? Why the property never sold, just sitting idle all these years? With the amount of land tied to it, the asking price would’ve been a steal.”</p>
		<p>Dave shrugged. “Who cares, as long as it translates into evidence.” He nodded at Cal. “You got the key?”</p>
		<p>Cal gave Avery a sideways glance, tossing Dave the key. “They said the lock’s a bit stiff.”</p>
		<p>Dave fiddled with it for a few minutes, finally shoving the door open. He looked at them across his shoulder. “I’ll go left, you two go right, and we’ll ensure this place is empty before we begin.”</p>
		<p>Cal grabbed his arm. “I think it’d be best if we stayed together.”</p>
		<p>Dave wrinkled the crease above his nose. “Why?”</p>
		<p>“A thousand reasons, really.”</p>
		<p>Dave snickered. “Look, if you two don’t think you can handle a couple of teenagers making out in here, that’s your problem. Otherwise, we need to clear this house and get down to business. It’s already twenty minutes after midnight. I don’t want to lose this time...not when it increases our chances of getting some concrete evidence.”</p>
		<p>He turned and yanked open the door, disappearing before Cal could do more than glance over at Avery. Avery gave him a slap on the shoulder then headed inside, moving off to the right. Cal cursed under his breath but followed suit, trailing behind his brother as they picked their way through what appeared to be an old parlor. Twin circles of light bobbed around the interior, illuminating different sections of the room, making the remaining areas seem even darker. A scattering of furniture still occupied the space, and other than a thick layer of dust, the pieces appeared to be in excellent condition.</p>
		<p>Cal tapped Avery on the shoulder when he stopped beside an elegant loveseat. “Don’t you find it just a bit odd that the furniture hasn’t degraded or dulled in the past seventy years?”</p>
		<p>Avery held out one of the machines. “With the way this needle is stuck to the right, I’d say it’s no coincidence. Something or someone is expending a lot of electromagnetic energy in this room.” He gave Cal a raise of one eyebrow. “Maybe it’s not just being used to appear and disappear.”</p>
		<p>“Are you trying to tell me that the furniture is enchanted?”</p>
		<p>“Enchanted. Entombed. Call it what you will, but unless they’ve got a caretaker who manages to keep the fabric in mint condition without dusting it, it’s not simply good fortune.” He motioned to the radio. “I think it’d be wise to do a session with Blake’s new gadget before we go upstairs. See if there are any spirits down here that might be able to give us some clues as to what else resides in here.”</p>
		<p>Cal nodded, scanning the room again as they circled back to the set of stairs by the front entrance. Dave stood at the base of the staircase, recorder in hand as he mumbled quietly, his flashlight focused on the floor.</p>
		<p>He looked up as they approached, giving Cal a wide smile. “Damn, this place is incredible. I swear it’s like stepping back in time. Everything looks original. There’re even pictures on some of the walls.”</p>
		<p>Cal smirked. “Yeah. It’s perfectly creepy.”</p>
		<p>Dave slapped him across the shoulder. “What’s wrong, buddy? Losing your nerve?”</p>
		<p>“There’s nothing wrong with being cautious. Unless you think it’s normal to have a house that’s been vacant for decades be this pristine.” He waved his hand at the adjoining rooms. “Other than the dust, nothing seems out of place.”</p>
		<p>“Maybe your brother got his facts wrong. If you ask me, this place hasn’t been abandoned for more than a few years.”</p>
		<p>Avery sighed. “Or maybe there’s more going on here than a simple haunting.”</p>
		<p>Dave gave them a wry grin. “Even better.”</p>
		<p>Cal moved forward when a loud bang rattled the house. He glanced up, noting the cloud of dust in the air. Whatever had made the noise, it’d definitely come from upstairs.</p>
		<p>Dave strode toward the stairs, ignoring Avery’s call as he took the steps two at a time.</p>
		<p>Cal watched his friend ascend, the man’s attention focused on the upper level. While Cal wasn’t one to dwell on danger or risks, he’d never seen Dave so oblivious to his surroundings before. As if he were merely going through the motions.</p>
		<p>Avery gave him a concerned furrow of his brow before heading upstairs, keeping a noticeable distance away from Dave. Cal just didn’t know if it was so Avery could avoid the man or study him.</p>
		<p>Cal ran a hand through his hair, picking his way along, listening for any further movement from above. Shadows chased each other along the walls as he rounded the top step, scanning both directions before turning right down the hallway and heading for the rear of the house. Muffled voices echoed along the corridor, and he stopped when he reached the last room. Footsteps sounded behind him as a hand landed on his shoulder.</p>
		<p>Cal spun around, the beam of light making Avery’s skin look yellow. He grunted, giving his little brother a shove. “Shit, Av. You scared a few years off me.”</p>
		<p>Avery gave him the same boyish smile he’d used as a kid, his teeth flashing white in the glare. “I checked out two of the rooms at the front, but they’re empty. Dave’s just checking the other one.” He leaned in after glancing over his shoulder. “I’m a bit...concerned about Dave. He doesn’t seem to hear a word I say.”</p>
		<p>“Maybe he’s just focused on the hunt. He’s been a bit obsessive with this one.”</p>
		<p>“Or maybe he’s not quite as strong willed as you think he is.”</p>
		<p>“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”</p>
		<p>Avery held up his hands, palms out. “Easy, bro. You know I like Dave, but...shit, I’m not getting anything off the man now.”</p>
		<p>Cal frowned. “But I thought you were worried because you were getting bad feelings off of him?” He shook his head. “Isn’t this better?”</p>
		<p>“It’s not like that. I mean I’m not getting anything off him. As in nothing. No thoughts, no emotions. It’s like he just flicked a switch.”</p>
		<p>Cal scrubbed a hand down his face, not sure how to reply when Dave marched down the hallway, the beam from his flashlight bouncing along the walls. He only slowed enough to edge past them before grabbing the handle of the door behind Cal.</p>
		<p>Cal snagged Dave’s shirt, finally gaining his attention when he tugged forcefully on the sleeve. Dave glanced at him, yanking his arm free as he all but growled at Cal.</p>
		<p>Cal moved forward, trapping Dave against the wall. “Damn it, Dave. What the hell is wrong with you?” He returned his friend’s glare. “First you bitch about Avery coming along then you start in about my family’s money. Now you’re acting as if we’re not even here! Either snap out of it, or I’ll drag your ass back to the truck. And don’t look at me like I can’t do it. We both know I’ve got four inches and twenty pounds on you, not to mention the fact my brother, Dylan, has taught me more than a few of his hand-to-hand combat techniques.”</p>
		<p>Dave furrowed his brow before shaking his head, blinking a few times as he stared back at them. He seemed to focus for a moment before shoving Cal away. “Shit, Cal, you need to relax. Maybe I just want to get some evidence before it disappears, instead of dragging my ass around, worrying about stuff that doesn’t have anything to do with the investigation.”</p>
		<p>“Disappears?” Cal ran a hand through his hair. “You haven’t stopped long enough to even gather evidence. And it’s not like the ghosts are going anywhere. Most likely their energy signature is somehow bound to the house. We need to slow down and get a better understanding of what we’re up against. Whether this is nothing more than some restless spirits or whether there’s something else here...something that’s messing with you.”</p>
		<p>Dave rolled his eyes. “Nothing’s messing with me. Seriously, you need to stop listening to Avery’s wild stories. I realize the guy has great instincts, but he’s still just a kid with a lot to learn. I’m fine.” He shoved Cal back, reaching for the handle again. “Now I’m going to check out the attic and ensure we’re alone before we begin.” He sneered at Cal. “You can come along or stay here.”</p>
		<p>Dave twisted the doorknob and yanked open the door, striding up the stairs without glancing at them. Cal swore under his breath, gaining the first step when Avery grabbed his wrist. Cal turned partway back, frustration clenching his jaw. If he’d doubted there was more to this house than a few resident ghosts, Dave’s bizarre attitude changes had successfully crushed those doubts.</p>
		<p>Cal took a calming breath, noting the rigid line of Avery’s jaw as he repeatedly clenched it. He gave his little brother an encouraging smile. “Don’t pay any attention to him. It’s like you said. The energy in this place must be making him pissy. I’m sure he’ll be embarrassed of his performance once he realizes how much of an ass he was.”</p>
		<p>Avery glanced up the stairs as he shook his head. “This isn’t about Dave taunting me. Hell, you and Dylan have teased me far worse than that, it’s just...this isn’t right. Dave...there’s something wrong, and it’s more than just a gut feeling. When he seemed to snap out of it for a moment back there, I sensed that same dark energy I felt when we first arrived. Only this time, it was coming from Dave...not the house.”</p>
		<p>“So what are you saying? That he’s channeling the energy?”</p>
		<p>“More like the other way round. The energy’s channeling through him.”</p>
		<p>Cal frowned. “How’s that different?”</p>
		<p>Avery kicked at the floor, seemingly reluctant to say what was obviously on his mind before he cursed and palmed the doorframe. “It’s different because it means the man’s under some kind of possession.”</p>
		<p>Cal snorted. “You think Dave’s been possessed by an evil spirit?”</p>
		<p>“This is more than just a spirit. And there’s no doubt in my mind it’s evil. Pure evil.”</p>
		<p>Cal groaned inwardly, mulling the idea over, when something crashed against the floor above them, sending more clouds of dust billowing down from the ceiling. Cal took the stairs two at time, shouldering his weight against the door at the top, cracking the frame as the wood gave beneath the force. He barreled into the room, skidding to a stop as he fought to see anything in the inky blackness when his flashlight winked out. Avery ducked in behind him, the beam from his flashlight flickering around the room. Boxes and bits of furniture appeared in the circle of light before graying into the shadows as Avery moved the beam around, scanning every inch of the area. Cal shook his light, but something had already drained the damn batteries.</p>
		<p>He pointed at a dark mound near the window. “Is that Dave?”</p>
		<p>Avery darted forward, reaching for Dave when his body shuddered and flew backwards, impacting the far wall with a resounding thud. He slid down the wall, eyes blinking as he obviously tried to shake off the blow. Cal ran over to him, palming his shoulder when an eerie laugh resonated through the room. A pale glow brightened the darkness atop an old table before exploding into a flash of white light.</p>
		<p>Cal covered his eyes against the harsh glare, squinting in an attempt to focus on the room. A large figure loomed closer, the outline of a woman clearly visible amidst the glow. Long tattered hair flowed around an oval face with eyes a distinctive shade of green. Cal stared at the apparition, instinctively switching on his video camera as the spirit hovered in the middle of the room, its lips cracking into an evil grin. Cal stood, but Avery snagged his wrist, preventing him from moving. He glared at his brother as he tried to pull free when an ear-piercing screech shook the wall.</p>
		<p>“Holy shit!” Cal covered one ear, still rolling on the footage as he turned back to the ghost.</p>
		<p>The light flashed again then faded into nothing more than a solitary beam. Spots from the abrupt flare dotted his vision, finally clearing enough he could make out a lone figure standing where the ghost had been only moments before.</p>
		<p>Cal shook his head, helping Avery to his feet as he managed to focus on the object. “Dave? Damn, are you okay?”</p>
		<p>Dave stared at him, his eyes fixed blankly on the far wall before he turned and walked over to the window.</p>
		<p>Cal took a few cautious steps forward, scanning the room again, praying he didn’t fall flat on his face as the surroundings flip-flopped a couple of times. “Dave. I asked if you were okay.”</p>
		<p>Avery pulled him to a stop when they reached the center, standing where the apparition had vanished. His jaw was clenched tight as he squinted at the other man.</p>
		<p>He shook his head at Cal. “I don’t think that’s Dave.”</p>
		<p>Cal frowned. “What the hell are you talking about? I can see him.”</p>
		<p>“Trust me. That’s not him. Or maybe a better explanation would be...it’s not just him.”</p>
		<p>Cal looked back at Dave, noting the way his body twitched. His hands were fisted at his side as he stared out the window. A tremor worked through the man’s torso before the tension appeared to ease.</p>
		<p>Cal gave Avery a quick glance before taking one more step. “Dave?”</p>
		<p>The man turned, his eyes flickering a dull shade of red before fading into gray. His lips curled into a smug smile. “I told you this was our big break, Cal.”</p>
		<p>His voice resonated, the eerie echo sending shivers along Cal’s spine.</p>
		<p>Cal nodded. “You called it. Now why don’t you come over here and we can go over the evidence I collected?”</p>
		<p>Dave laughed, the tone disturbingly similar to the one that had sounded before. “I have all the evidence I need.”</p>
		<p>He reached behind him, the motion followed by a metallic rattling noise. Cal darted ahead, only to bounce back, landing hard on his ass. Pain flared through his body, blurring the surroundings. Avery’s voice washed in and out of pitch as Cal shook off the haze, finally blinking the room back into focus. His breath left him on a gasp as he watched Dave swing open the window, climbing onto the ledge. He leaned out, gazing at the ground as he hummed just loud enough the tune floated along the air like a cold breeze. The melody was haunting and strangely alluring.</p>
		<p>Cal pushed to his feet, tumbling against the wall as he took a staggered step forward. The floor felt uneven as if the entire house had been knocked off its foundation. He pushed the sudden roll of nausea away, bracing his weight as Dave stepped onto the frame.</p>
		<p>“Damn it, Dave, what the hell are you doing? Get down!”</p>
		<p>Dave straightened, his head on the outside of the window. He gave Cal one last smile, his face morphing into the apparition he’d seen earlier. The woman grinned, her hair blowing wildly about her face as she rose above Dave, watching as he teetered forward, disappearing into the darkness.</p>
		<p>“No!” Cal dashed forward, somehow making it to the window this time as the spirit faded, vanishing as he reached the opening.</p>
		<p>He stared at the ground, barely registering Avery’s voice in the background as the man called for help. But Cal didn’t need a doctor to know it was too late. He just didn’t know if Dave’s soul had died with him.</p>
