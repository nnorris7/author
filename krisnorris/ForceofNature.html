		<p>“Damn it, Coen, I’m not going to argue my worth to you, so just fuck off, already.”</p>
		<p>He snapped—the pain in her eyes, her choice of words hitting him like a physical blow. He moved his hand off the wall, palming the back of her head as he drew his thumb forward, tracing a line along the edge of her ear to her jaw as he claimed her mouth, thrusting his tongue inside when she gasped in surprise. Womanly sweetness with a hint of coffee filled his senses, the firm drag of her tongue across his only making him more desperate.</p>
		<p>Her fingers clenched around his sweater—not quite pushing him away but not drawing him closer as he finally eased back, his breath mixing with hers as he hovered an inch away. A thousand thoughts tumbled through his head, and he didn’t know whether to leave or kiss her again.</p>
		<p>Finley swallowed noisily, her good hand trembling slightly against his chest. “If you think I’m going to admit I’m wrong just because you kissed me…”</p>
		<p>“God no. You’d never be that reasonable.” He brushed his lips along hers. “And I don’t give up when I’m not wrong, either.”</p>
		<p>Her fingers tightened, inching him closer as she nipped at his bottom lip. “Don’t you ever shut up?”</p>
		<p>He accepted her challenge, eating at her mouth as he crushed her chest against his. Her nipples peaked against his pecs, the hard tips spiking his dick against his zipper. All the reasons for not taking her as his lover blurred into the scratch of her nails across his scalp as she speared one hand through his hair, tugging on the short strands. He shifted his hips, aligning his cock with her mound. Finley moaned into his mouth, tilting her groin forward as she ground herself against his length.</p>
		<p>Coen broke the kiss, anger still clouding his head. If he hadn’t followed her… He maintained eye contact, resisting the smile that twitched his lips when her eyelids fluttered open, her eyes glassy with arousal. “Fuck, Finley.”</p>
		<p>“That had better be your plan.”</p>
		<p>“This doesn’t change what you did. You’re still reckless.”</p>
		<p>“And you’re still an ass.”</p>
		<p>He growled, fisting her hair as he tugged her head to the side, biting at the lean muscle threading into her shoulder. “It’s not going to be gentle, sweetheart.”</p>
		<p>“Did I ask for gentle?” She pulled against his hold, moaning when he simply repeated his action. “God, Coen.”</p>
		<p>“I knew you’d taste just a bit wild.” He eased back enough to squeeze one hand between them, leaving the other buried in her hair. He flicked open the buttons on her shirt, pushing it aside before shoving his hand inside her bra top. Her nipple pebbled against his palm as he lifted her breast out of the cloth, baring it to the harsh light of the cabin. “So fucking pretty.”</p>
		<p>He dipped down, taking the hard bud in his mouth, pressing it between his tongue and the roof of his mouth. Finley arched against him, her head connecting with the wall. He glanced up at her, enjoying the way her eyes squeezed shut as she seemed to force air in and out through her nose.</p>
		<p>He licked at her flesh, chuckling when she pressed her groin against his cock again, a shiver trembling through her. “Are you trying to get yourself off without me? Dangerous decision.”</p>
		<p>“I need—”</p>
		<p>“What you need is to take what I fucking give you."</p>
