The cryptic note. The contradictory evidence. The violence. There’s no doubt in her mind her life’s about to get complicated. Add Special Agent Deacon McGraw into the mix—a man she’s had an unfortunate crush on for the past six months—and it’s shaping up to get downright messy.\n\nDeacon has waited twenty years to solve his father’s murder. If his calculations are correct, this recent killing is connected to it, and the start of something grisly. After nearly convincing himself his father’s outlandish theories on a cold case were nothing more than a slow slide into madness, Deacon’s suddenly faced with a harsh truth—no one’s going to believe him, either.\n\nCaitlyn’s not sure what to make of Deacon’s claims. But she’s willing to give him a chance—one that quickly translates into more than just a working relationship. Becoming lovers carries more risks than simple heartbreak. One miscalculation, or a loss of faith, and they just might lose their souls.", "trailer": "", "price": 4.99, "heatLevel": "Garnet", "length": "Novel", "language": "English", "genre": "Paranormal/Horror, Suspense/Mystery/Thriller, Action/Adventure", "seriesSortOrder": 1, "series": "na", "iBSItemIdentifier": "1121842260", "iBSPrice": 4.99, "iBSmt": 11, "iBSct": "krisnorris-app-1.5.2", "affiliateLink": "https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/my-soul-to-keep/id1121842260?mt=11&at=11lNAQ"},

That is until her ghost returns—angrier than ever and hell bent on finally completing her mission. She wants Daniel to join her…and she’s not taking no for an answer.\n\nArrynn Baker has spent the past two years watching Daniel flourish into one of Threshold’s best hunters. Decisive, highly skilled—she’s proud to be his partner. There’s just one small issue… She’s fallen for the man. Hard. While she’s not opposed to taking him as a lover, she’s not convinced he feels the same—not with the distance he seems to maintain. The emotional walls he never steps beyond. Besides, mixing business with pleasure rarely ends well.\n\nWhen a grisly new killing rocks both their worlds, lines get crossed, and Daniel knows he’s got a choice to make. Either be content with one night with Arrynn, or man up and jump in. But, if he wants a future with the woman of his dreams, he needs to deal with his past, once and for all.
